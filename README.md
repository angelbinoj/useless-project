# What's My Poop Mood? 🚽💩

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Dora Bhuji

### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Aishwarya Lakshmi MB] - [Sahrdaya College of Advanced Studies]
- Member 2: [Angel Binoj] - [Sahrdaya College of Advanced Studies]

### Project Description
A hilarious interactive web application that analyzes your current mood and translates it into entertaining poop-themed responses, complete with custom sound effects, floating tissue animations, and mood-based background music.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are constantly wondering what their poop would feel like if it had emotions based on their current mood. There's a severe lack of scientific poop mood analysis tools in the world, leaving millions of people unable to understand the emotional state of their bowel movements.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created the world's first AI-powered* poop mood analyzer that combines cutting-edge mood detection technology with sophisticated fecal emotional intelligence. Simply select your mood, and our advanced algorithm will reveal your poop's personality with hilarious results, complete with immersive sound effects and tissue animations!

*Not actually AI-powered, just random responses 😄
